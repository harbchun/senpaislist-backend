Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.

Due to his father's work, he had to constantly transfer schools, and thus he has never managed to become a part of society. When he is forced to join the gardening club by his cheerful classmate Ayaka Shinozaki, Narumi encounters the genius hacker Alice, who lives in isolation above Hanamaru, the ramen shop where Ayaka works part-time. He then discovers that Alice is running a special private detective agency, and that all her professional associates refer to themselves as \"NEET\"s: Not in Education, Employment, or Training. Joining the NEET detective agency due to his personal connection with a criminal case, Narumi finds himself entangled in a world of dangerous investigations conducted by the ill-assorted group of detectives, all the while trying to track down the crime syndicate which seems to have mysterious ties to Alice.

Each of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, \"Fukuoka-ken\" being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi. Another feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc. (Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)", "season": "summer", "year": "2011", "num_episodes": 26, "episode_duration": "1 min per ep", "airing": false, "current_status": "Finished Airing", "next_broadcast": "N/A", "score": 5.61, "scored_by": 105, "rank": 9340, "popularity": 12791, "favorites": 2, "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/67133.jpg"}, {"title": "Robot Pulta", "title_jp": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d1\u30eb\u30bf", "start_day": 4, "start_month": 4, "start_year": 1995, "end_day": 0, "end_month": 0, "end_year": 0, "source": "Unknown", "studio": "N/A", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Kids", "Mecha"], "rating": "G - All Ages", "description": "Stop-motion animation about robots; though mainly focusing on Pulta a white square robot.", "season": "summer", "year": "2011", "num_episodes": 0, "episode_duration": "5 min", "airing": true, "current_status": "Currently Airing", "next_broadcast": "N/A", "score": 0, "scored_by": 0, "rank": 11640, "popularity": 14965, "favorites": 0, "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/70637.jpg"}, {"title": "Momonga-mon", "title_jp": "\u3082\u3082\u3093\u304c\u3041\u30e2\u30f3", "start_day": 4, "start_month": 7, "start_year": 2005, "end_day": 24, "end_month": 3, "end_year": 2017, "source": "Unknown", "studio": "N/A", "genres": ["Adventure", "Kids"], "rating": "PG - Children", "description": "Stop-motion animation about a mysterious creature Mont-chan from an unknown world looking for an adventure.", "season": "summer", "year": "2011", "num_episodes": 15, "episode_duration": "5 min per ep", "airing": false, "current_status": "Finished Airing", "next_broadcast": "N/A", "score": 0, "scored_by": 0, "rank": 15592, "popularity": 15426, "favorites": 0, "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/70647.jpg"}, {"title": "Shiro Hon", "title_jp": "\u767d\u3044\u672c", "start_day": 2, "start_month": 4, "start_year": 2007, "end_day": 24, "end_month": 12, "end_year": 2012, "source": "Unknown", "studio": "N/A", "genres": ["Adventure", "Kids"], "rating": "G - All Ages", "description": "Papercraft stop-motion animation featuring tales ranging from a colourful jungle to a sports car race.", "season": "summer", "year": "2011", "num_episodes": 6, "episode_duration": "5 min per ep", "airing": false, "current_status": "Finished Airing", "next_broadcast": "N/A", "score": 0, "scored_by": 0, "rank": 11932, "popularity": 15899, "favorites": 0, "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/70649.jpg"}, {"title": "Ousama Monogatari", "title_jp": "\u738b\u3055\u307e\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a", "start_day": 21, "start_month": 5, "start_year": 2007, "end_day": 11, "end_month": 11, "end_year": 2016, "source": "Original", "studio": "N/A", "genres": ["Adventure", "Kids"], "rating": "G - All Ages", "description": "Stop-motion animation made out of fabric following a curious king sneaking out of his castle.", "season": "summer", "year": "2011", "num_episodes": 10, "episode_duration": "5 min per ep", "airing": false, "current_status": "Finished Airing", "next_broadcast": "N/A", "score": 0, "scored_by": 0, "rank": 11351, "popularity": 14265, "favorites": 0, "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/70669.jpg"}, {"title": "Mori no Ratio", "title_jp": "\u68ee\u306e\u30ec\u30b7\u30aa", "start_day": 26, "start_month": 3, "start_year": 2010, "end_day": 20, "end_month": 11, "end_year": 2017, "source": "Unknown", "studio": "N/A", "genres": ["Adventure", "Kids", "Fantasy"], "rating": "G - All Ages", "description": "Stop-motion anime about a girl named Ratio who lives in a forest with her icy monsters and creatures.

The movie starts when a pink shooting star falls down from the night sky and soughts out a toy store, striking one of the Cure Dolls of Melody on display. The Melody Doll comes alive, freeing herself from her box. Jumping to the floor, she explores the toy store when she hears the noise of a crowd coming from outside. Running out of the store, she discovers a huge TV screen which reflects a \"real-life\" image of herself. Playing around with it, she is soon joined by a Cure Doll of Rhythm.

Nodding to each other, the two slide down the keyboard onto the dance floor, and the concert began. The concert ends with a shot of the huge TV screen shown during the introduction. The 3 Suite\u266a Cures are seen smiling and waving at the audience, and as the shot zoomed out, the 3 Cure Dolls are shown at the bottom of the screen.

The creators would like to see children develop tolerance and a broad-minded mental outlook that would enable them to accept each person they encounter.

These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones.

An unfortunate accident took everything from Ryouken. In the days of self-abandonment and suffering in darkness, Ryouken finds the teachings of the high priest Rennyo. In it, he finds answers to the question \"Why live\" as explained by the sage Shinran. As he is drawn into the teachings and no longer hesitates, Ryouken becomes Rennyo's apprentice. The number of worshippers increase, but the Honganji temple becomes a target of the other sects, forcing Ryouken and Rennyo to flee from Kyoto. In order to find a new place to teach, they arrive in Yoshizaki (now in Fukui Prefecture) in the Hokuriku region.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Other": [{"mal_id": 39479, "type": "anime", "name": "Tannishou wo Hiraku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39479/Tannishou_wo_Hiraku"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1406, "type": "anime", "name": "Miracle Bus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1406/Miracle_Bus"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

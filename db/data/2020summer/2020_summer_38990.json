The scum villain, Shen Qingqiu, is one of those looks-noble-but-is-actually-a-hypocrite type. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s disciple, Luo Binghe, is the main character of the novel who gradually turns darker as tragic events occur upon him. With the help of a very troll system, the new Shen Qingqiu tries to stay alive by staying on Luo Binghe\u2019s good side, as the original Shen Qingqiu treated Luo Binghe badly, thus receiving a horrifying ending. However, Shen Qingqiu's plan of staying alive is not as simple as it seems as he soon finds out that the system limits his actions. This is a sometimes angsty, but also touching, story of a master and his disciple.

Cleaning the man's room, Asumi gets a startling insight into just how frustrating the life of a single parent can be. He finds a pile of adult videos, which results in plenty of implications. Despite Naruse being a man, Asumi finds himself completely drawn in by his employer's beautiful face and gentle personality.

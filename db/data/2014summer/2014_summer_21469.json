The robotic cat calls himself Doraemon, who claims to have been pressured by Sewashi to assist Nobita, with their ultimate goal being to provide Nobita happiness. Frustrated after seeing Nobita's hopeless state, Doraemon decides to go back to the future. However, Sewashi activates a program within Doraemon that prevents him from doing so. Forced to stay, Doraemon helps Nobita using futuristic gadgets through his four-dimensional pocket\u2014a bag containing anything inside it.

A collection of Kalos records reveals that Aila's true love, Jan, attempted to vanquish the Destruction Pok\u00e9mon Yveltal. When he failed, the land was drained of all life as Yveltal became a cocoon and turned Aila to stone. Jan continued his quest, seeking out the Life Pok\u00e9mon Xerneas to replenish the barren land\u2014although it couldn't save Aila. When Kalos seemed hopelessly out of balance, the Order Pok\u00e9mon Zygarde appeared to restore it, and Jan remained at Aila\u2019s side as the cycle of life and destruction continued.

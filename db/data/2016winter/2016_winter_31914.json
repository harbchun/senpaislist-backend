His classmate, Sayuki Kuroda notices his talent, decides to help him find a way to use it properly by enlisting him in her bishoujo game development group. When Buntarou is cornered in the men's bathroom at school by Sayuki, he is surprised when he is asked out on what he thinks is a date, and even further surprised when he finds out that it's not a date, but a job interview. Reluctantly agreeing, the two start recruiting other members for their team but will they learn more about game creation, or life itself along the way?", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2016", "broadcast": "Thursdays at 22:30 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 95107, "type": "manga", "name": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu: Tori Naku Uta", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/95107/Shoujo-tachi_wa_Kouya_wo_Mezasu__Tori_Naku_Uta"}, {"mal_id": 114902, "type": "manga", "name": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu: Yukidoke no Oto", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/114902/Shoujo-tachi_wa_Kouya_wo_Mezasu__Yukidoke_no_Oto"}], "Other": [{"mal_id": 31867, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu: Iubeki Monokashira", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31867/Shoujo-tachi_wa_Kouya_wo_Mezasu__Iubeki_Monokashira"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 306, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic Capsule", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"}, {"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

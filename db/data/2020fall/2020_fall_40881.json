Ash and Pikachu encounter Coco during an adventure. The film focuses on the theme of a \"human raised by Pok\u00e9mon,\" instead of the previous films' focus of the \"bond between a human trainer and their Pok\u00e9mon.\" (Source: ANN)", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Alternative setting": [{"mal_id": 527, "type": "anime", "name": "Pokemon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/527/Pokemon"}], "Prequel": [{"mal_id": 36927, "type": "anime", "name": "Pokemon Movie 21: Minna no Monogatari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36927/Pokemon_Movie_21__Minna_no_Monogatari"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 1501, "type": "anime", "name": "JR East Marketing & Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Game"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Coco (\u30b3\u30b3)\" by Beverly"], "ending_themes": ["\"Fushigi na Fushigi na Ikimono featuring vocal Tortoise Matsumoto (\u3075\u3057\u304e\u306a\u3075\u3057\u304e\u306a\u751f\u304d\u3082\u306e featuring vocal \u30c8\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u677e\u672c)\" by Taiiku Okazaki"]}

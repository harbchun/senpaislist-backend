With the Winter Continuous Track Cup rapidly approaching, Momo becomes the commander of Ooarai's tankery team, so as to demonstrate her sport skills and wipe away the stain on her honor. Their first opponent\u2014French-themed BC Freedom High School\u2014is split into two factions that are constantly at odds with each other.

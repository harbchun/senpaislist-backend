In order to pursue his dream to the best of his elementary school abilities, Tsubasa moves with his mother to Nankatsu city, which is well-known for its excellent elementary school soccer teams. But although he was easily the best in his old town, Nankatsu has a lot more competition, and he will need all of his skill and talent in order to stand out from this new crowd. He encounters not only rivals, but also new friends like the pretty girl Sanae Nakazawa and the talented goalkeeper, Genzo Wakabayashi, who shares the same passion as Tsubasa, and will prove to be a treasured friend in helping him push towards his dreams. Representing Japan in the FIFA World Cup is Tsubasa\u2019s ultimate dream, but it will take a lot more than talent to reach it.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2018", "broadcast": "Tuesdays at 01:35 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1789, "type": "manga", "name": "Captain Tsubasa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1789/Captain_Tsubasa"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 2116, "type": "anime", "name": "Captain Tsubasa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2116/Captain_Tsubasa"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

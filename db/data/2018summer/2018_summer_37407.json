He has a lot of brainwork to get busy with \u2013 after all, he'll be an adult in just a few thousand days. For the moment, though, he'll have to live life as a fourth-grader.

And a colony of penguins has materialized in the middle of Aoyama's sleepy little town. Where on Earth \u2013 or elsewhere \u2013 did these waddling interlopers come from? Aoyama and his friends embark on a research mission, applying rigorous scientific methods and principles. Their discoveries, however, only lead to ever more puzzling wonders...

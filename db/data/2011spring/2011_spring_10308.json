One day Yoshino visits a local shrine to pray in order to pass her upcoming test. However, Yoshino sees a blue light coming from inside the Shrine and looks inside to find a mysterious person performing a magic spell. In a stroke of bad luck, Yoshino trips on a small bell and crashes into the shrine, prompting the stranger to catch her. Upon Yoshino's capture, the magic spell spirals out of control and sends Yoshino back in time to the Sengoku Era. Yoshino then encounters Akechi Mitsuhide and Oda Nobunaga. But unlike what really happened during the era, Hideyoshino realizes that everyone in the world is female. She then decides to help Oda Nobunaga find the Crimson Armor which is said to allow the person wearing the armor to conquer all of Japan.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2011", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 26791, "type": "manga", "name": "Hyakka Ryouran: Sengoku Otome - Haruna Denshou-hen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/26791/Hyakka_Ryouran__Sengoku_Otome_-_Haruna_Denshou-hen"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 73, "type": "anime", "name": "TMS Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Kagerou (\u967d\u708e\uff0d\uff4b\uff41\uff47\uff45\uff52\uff4f\uff55\uff0d)\" by Tenka Tori Tai (\u5929\u4e0b\u53d6\u308a\u968a) (Satomi Akesaka, Mariya Ise, Sachi Kokuryu, Rei Mochizuki)"], "ending_themes": ["#1: \"Atsuki Ya no Gotoku (\u71b1\u304d\u77e2\u306e\u5982\u304f)\" by Tenka Tori Tai (eps 1-9, 11-12)", "#2: \"Atsuki Ya no Gotoku ~Shinjuu Otome Version~ (\u71b1\u304d\u77e2\u306e\u5982\u304f\uff5e\u5fc3\u4e2d\u4e59\u5973\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff5e)\" by Eri Kitamura (ep 10)", "#3:  \"Ashita e (\u3042\u3057\u305f\u3078)\"  by Rina Hidaka (ep 13)"]}

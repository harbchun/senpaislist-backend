Unfortunately, the project was canceled, leaving only a 52 second trailer. The concept of the series: The story takes place in Kisshou City, one of a few remaining oases surrounded by lifeless land devastated by a long world war. Wreckages of humanoid weapons, called \"Legacies\", are collected and reassembled by the residents of the city. One day, a gang of bandits approaches the city to seize the secrets hidden in the Legacies. The mayor decides to intercept them with a special robot \u03a999, which has remained intact since the war. A teenage boy Yamato is called up for the pilot. He is just an ordinary gamer who doesn't even know about the city's crisis.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 384, "type": "anime", "name": "Trick Block", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/384/Trick_Block"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

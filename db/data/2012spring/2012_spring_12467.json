From that moment onward, things between Urabe and Akira are never the same, and the mysterious girl slowly becomes Akira's mysterious girlfriend. Along with their friends Ueno Kouhei and Oka Ayuko, Akira and Urabe try and navigate the minefield of high school first romance and all the strange things that happen along the way.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2012", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1926, "type": "manga", "name": "Nazo no Kanojo X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1926/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X"}], "Side story": [{"mal_id": 13093, "type": "anime", "name": "Nazo no Kanojo X: Nazo no Natsu Matsuri", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/13093/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X__Nazo_no_Natsu_Matsuri"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 675, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/675/Yomiuri_Advertising"}, {"mal_id": 1175, "type": "anime", "name": "Atelier Musa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1175/Atelier_Musa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 346, "type": "anime", "name": "Hoods Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/346/Hoods_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Koi no Orchestra (\u604b\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9)\" by Ayako Yoshitani"], "ending_themes": ["\"Houkago no Yakusoku (\u653e\u8ab2\u5f8c\u306e\u7d04\u675f)\" by Ayako Yoshitani"]}

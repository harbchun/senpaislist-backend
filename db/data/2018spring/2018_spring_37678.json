Meisaku-kun where the characters wonder what the next grade will be like. The first episode, they wonder what 7th grade will be like. At the end of the 2nd season (aka episode 78) in the main anime, the students graduated the 6th grade. The short breaks the 4th wall as the characters also request the viewer to continue watching the show with the 3rd season starting on April 6th, 2018. The second episode follows a similar structure. The kids just graduated 8th grade at the end of season 4 (ep 156) and reminsce about their favorite events that occurred. They hope the viewers will continue watching their soon to be final year of middle school starting on April 3rd, 2020.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Parent story": [{"mal_id": 32956, "type": "anime", "name": "Aware!

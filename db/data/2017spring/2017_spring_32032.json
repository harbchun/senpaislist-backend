While departing on a business trip, a giant cube materializes and his plane is taken undamaged into the mysterious, indestructible structure.

He assures Shindou that the passengers are not in any danger and requests help in negotiations with the human world. Hailing from a higher dimensional universe known as Novo, Yaha-kui zaShunina is able to transfer information between Novo and Shindou's universe through a cube called Kado. Despite having these unfathomable abilities, he does not appear hostile. Instead, he announces that he has come to this world with only one intention: to \"advance\" humanity\u2014starting with Japan.

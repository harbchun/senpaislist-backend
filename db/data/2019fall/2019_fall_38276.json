One day after school, she crosses paths with her classmate Aya Takayashiki, who takes her on a little adventure. Miki discovers wonders she had never seen before, opening a way to change her withdrawn life. On their way home, Miki and Aya see their class representative Midori Oono entering Saikoro Club, a store specializing in board games.

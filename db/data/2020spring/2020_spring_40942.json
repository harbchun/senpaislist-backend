For a time, this realization brought the Build Divers to a halt. However, their bond with Freddie and the other people of Eldora, who fought with them against the One-eyes, brings Hiroto, Kazami, May, and Parviz back together again. To find Masaki Shido, the Diver whose consciousness is still trapped on Eldora... To discover the true nature of Alus, the mysterious leader of the One-eyes... And most of all, to save Freddie and their other precious comrades. There is still a remaining \"mission\" they must clear on Eldora. With the power of their newly built Gunpla, the true battle of the second Build Divers will now begin.

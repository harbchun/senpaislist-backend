Once forces of evil appear, these warriors, called the Saints will present themselves. A young woman, Saori Kido, learns about this force known as \"Cosmos\" and that she is the reincarnation of Athena, protector of love and peace on Earth. However, the Pope of the Sanctuary, who is in the charge of all the Saints, does not take kindly to Saori, and targets her for usurping the identity of Athena. An assassin is sent out to kill her. Fortunately, one of the Bronze Saints, Seiya, manages to protect her. But will Seiya be able to protect Saori through to the end in the gripping saga of Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary?", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 1254, "type": "anime", "name": "Saint Seiya", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Hero (Yoshiki Classical Version)\" by Yoshiki feat.

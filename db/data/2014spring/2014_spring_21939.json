Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi. During his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals\u2014those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi\u2014inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen.

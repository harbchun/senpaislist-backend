Now at the end of his middle school career, Keita studies fervently to be able to attend Ako and Riko's high school. While doing so however, he must resolve his conflicting feelings for his siblings and either reject or succumb to his sisters' intimate advances. Fortunately\u2014or perhaps unfortunately for Keita\u2014his sisters aren't the only women lusting after him, and there's no telling when the allure of temptation will get the better of the boy as well.

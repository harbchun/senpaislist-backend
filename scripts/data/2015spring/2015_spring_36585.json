The first video is about their third party medical inheritance called \"Doctor to Doctor.\" Japan has a lot of independent medical clinics. As the doctor ages, they might not be able to help their patients as much. If the doctor dies of old age, the clinic's patients would suffer if they needed medical attention ASAP or suffer confusion as to how to transfer to another clinic with their medical records. The Doctor to Doctor Concierge service Sougou Medical Koushiki helps team up younger doctors with older doctors so that in the event the older doctor can not longer take care of their patients, the younger doctor would be fully equipped to take over so that no patients are neglected or left behind. The second video is about their Sougou Yakkyoku service. The company provides a pharmacist to explain what medications are, when to take them, and offers easy directions with big visual guides. Some elderly patients get confused or have difficulty reading when there are so many medications to take. So this service it meant to take away the pressure and guilt they might feel from not being able to follow along the back of the packages.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1746, "type": "anime", "name": "Pops Inc.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1746/Pops_Inc"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

What if there was a police car that praises drivers? \"Instead of punishing bad driving, let's reward good driving\" is the motto. The project is aimed to decrease car accidents on the metropolitan expressway. It is an animation that illustrates the dream of a Tokyo Smart Driver. The person driving the car is an ordinary man. He's zooming by while listening to his favorite driving song when he suddenly sees a pink car approaching him in the rearview mirror. What will be this man's destiny? *This animation is fictitious.

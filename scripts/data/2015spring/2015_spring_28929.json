He does, however, hunt vampires. Using three-minute episodes, Vampire Holmes retells the story of the great Holmes and his assistant. What begins as an ordinary detective agency takes a turn for the occult when the Metropolitan Police of London secretly hire Holmes and Hudson to investigate vampires. Or at least that's what Holmes would tell anyone who asks. In reality, he and Hudson spend most of their time sitting around arguing, and failing to solve any cases. Joined by the not-so-black, demon cat Kira, and their terrifying rent-hungry landlady, this is the story of the man who was most definitely not London's greatest detective.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2015", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)", "related": {}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1795, "type": "anime", "name": "CUCURI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1795/CUCURI"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1266, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio!

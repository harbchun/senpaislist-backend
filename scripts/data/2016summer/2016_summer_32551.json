Just then, the Chosen Children receive a message from the mysterious entity Homeostasis, who informs them that their world is in danger of total destruction\u2014and the Digital World, the home of the Digimon, is too. Homeostasis plans to enact a \"Reboot,\" which will reset all the data that makes up the Digital World and eradicate the infection.

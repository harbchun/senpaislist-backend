(abbr. Meitetsu) as part of their \"Place important feelings on places where important people wait.\" campaign. In the short we see a woman and her fianc\u00e9 on a Nagoya Railroad train to go meet her parents. The woman laments over her youth from having fun as a child with her father on the train, to coldly ignoring him and being mean as a teenager when he comes to pick her up from the station with a spare umbrella on a rainy day. Time healed all wounds and the short ends with the both of them smiling cheerfully as they treasure each other.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

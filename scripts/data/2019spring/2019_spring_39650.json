Essential Free & Easy Cool Wax Shampoo and Conditioner are real products Kao Japan makes, they are meant to help remove hair wax from men's hair and condition the hair so it is more receptive to new wax when the hair is then dried and styled again. Takashi Taniguchi known for his bizarre animation style, animated the web commercial. It's a ballad of a man who is in pain from having to scrub out his hair wax every day and frustratingly pulls his hair as he has to restyle the next day. An anthropomorphic Essential Free & Easy Cool Wax Shampoo and Conditioner tell him to use them so that his pain can go away. He is very happy with the results.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Dementia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Dementia"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

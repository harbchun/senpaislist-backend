Space Shower TV is a music video channel in Japan similar to MTV. Between segments there are sometimes small animations featuring the station ID. The campaign was launched to invite all animators to come and submit works featuring the station's ID. The only requirement was that the animation is between 15-90 seconds in length. In order to encourage indie artists, all videos were shown on the specially created website; and 10 professional artists' creations (including Mirai Mizue) were already there to give examples of what Space Shower TV was looking for in content.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Dementia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Dementia"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}

One night, a young man named Takuto Tsunashi washes up on the island's shore and is rescued by Sugata Shindou and his fianc\u00e9e Wako Agemaki, one of the island's seal maidens. After he awakens, Takuto quickly befriends the two and proceeds to enroll at the local academy, where many of his fellow students are secretly members of Glittering Crux. However, Takuto holds a secret: when in Zero Time, he can utilize a Cybody of his own\u2014the Tauburn.

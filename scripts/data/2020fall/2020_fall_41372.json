A god who called himself Odin came to the aid of humanity as it was driven to near complete defeat. To counter the Pillars, Odin declared a counterattack by bequeathing humanity with the battle maidens Walk\u00fcres and the \"herocraft\" as their wings. Several years later, the battle between humanity and Pillars rages on, with men supporting the Walk\u00fcres as they soar through the treacherous skies to save the world. Japan is no exception. Three Walk\u00fcres confront the giant Pillar looming over sacred Mt. Fuji. Each Walk\u00fcre is skilled, but each also has issues. And now, an ace pilot has arrived from Europe. \"Now is the time to fight back, humanity. The day of reckoning has arrived. The time of Ragnarok draws nears.\" (Source: ANN)", "background": null, "premiered": "Fall 2020", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)", "related": {"Summary": [{"mal_id": 44236, "type": "anime", "name": "Senyoku no Sigrdrifa: Dai-909 Senjutsu Hime-tai Sentou Kiroku!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44236/Senyoku_no_Sigrdrifa__Dai-909_Senjutsu_Hime-tai_Sentou_Kiroku"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}, {"mal_id": 1554, "type": "anime", "name": "Contents Seed", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"}, {"mal_id": 1858, "type": "anime", "name": "Sonilude", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1858/Sonilude"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Higher's High\" by Akari Nanawo"], "ending_themes": ["#1: \"Sayonara Namida (\u30b5\u30e8\u30ca\u30e9\u30ca\u30df\u30c0)\" by Spira Spica (eps 2-3)", "#2: \"Fly high\" by Miyako Muguruma (Nene Hieda) (ep 4)"]}

In Starry Sky, the 13 constellations of the Zodiac are personified into handsome young men. The anime will be directed by Kiyomo Sayaka who worked with Vampire Knight. Similar to Hetalia - Axis Powers, Starry Sky's anime will be distributed through the Animate.tv website and other means.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 22901, "type": "manga", "name": "Starry\u2606Sky", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/22901/Starry\u2606Sky"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["#1: \"Starry\u2606Days\uff5einst ver.\uff5e\" by eba (eps 1-12)", "#2: \"Starry\u2606Days\uff5eVocal ver.\uff5e\" by Hikaru Midorikawa, Kenichi Suzumura, and Jun Fukuyama (eps 13-26)"]}

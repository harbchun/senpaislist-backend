Suddenly, a howling noise rang through the city, and when it died down, all music was gone. Ako and Mephisto tried to establish contact with Major Land, but could not get a response. Full of worry, Hibiki and the others headed to Major Land, where there was no sign of the former land of overflowing music. The world was desolate without sound, its people devoid of emotion like stone, continuing to play their soundless instruments. The only one left was Ako's friend Suzu, who explained how Aphrodite suddenly changed and took away all music from the land. Ako and Mephisto, unbelieving and determined to find out the truth, headed to the palace where Aphrodite was. Hibiki, Kanade and Ellen decided to chase after Suzu, who had run away after Ako refused to believe her story. While chasing after Suzu, the girls met with 3 men eager to steal the Healing Chest. And as the truth slowly came to light, the Pretty Cure had to face up to the real enemy.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Parent story": [{"mal_id": 9893, "type": "anime", "name": "Suite Precure\u266a", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/9893/Suite_Precure\u266a"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/16/Magic"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "opening_themes": ["\"La\u266a La\u266a La\u266a Suite Pretty Cure\u266a ~Unlimited Ver.~ (\u30e9\u266a\u30e9\u266a\u30e9\u266a\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u266a~\u221eUNLIMITED\u221e ver~)\" by Mayu Kudo"], "ending_themes": []}
